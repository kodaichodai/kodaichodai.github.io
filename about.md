Thanks for swinging by this page! My name is Kodai Kubono. I, as a white hat hacker, also go by the name of kodaichodai. On this website, I'm going to be writing mostly about some of my findings, study notes and journals. If you had any questions or comments related to any of the blogs posts I create, please let me know on X([@weeshter](https://twitter.com/weeshter))
